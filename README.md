# Module-20-Credit-Risk-Classification
files for Data Boot Camp Module 20 Credit Risk Classification Challenge

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge I used Python and supervised learning techniques to evaluate a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. I completed the following: 

1. Split the data into training and testing sets. 

2. Created a logistic regression model. 

##### Analysis: The logistic regression model predicts healthy loans with 100% precision, and predicts high-risk loans with 87% precision. Further analysis is required as 100% predicition precision is uncommon. See report for more information.
